				</DocumentPart>
				<DocumentPart type="Text">
					<sentence certainty="certain" id="S1521.2">The Clinton problem: The Clinton administration had presided over an economic boom and the balancing of the federal budget.</sentence>
					<sentence certainty="certain" id="S1521.3">Normally, a Vice President running under such circumstances would have played up his connection to the administration.</sentence>
					<sentence certainty="certain" id="S1521.4">Clinton's personal scandals, however, made that approach more problematic for Gore.</sentence>
					<sentence certainty="uncertain" id="S1521.5"><ccue>It has been suggested</ccue> that he should have involved Clinton much more heavily in his campaign considering President Clinton's approval ratings were in the high 60s throughout 2000 and that Clinton had helped Democrats pick up seats in Congress in the 1998 midterm elections, in which Democrats made significant gains; <ccue>others</ccue> have said that he should have done more to distance himself from Clinton.</sentence>
					<sentence certainty="certain" id="S1521.6">The Lieberman problem: Gore's choice of moderate senator Joe Lieberman as his running mate alienated many of those on the left of the Democratic Party.</sentence>
					<sentence certainty="certain" id="S1521.7">Many voters who otherwise may have supported Gore turned to the Green Party candidate, Ralph Nader.</sentence>
					<sentence certainty="certain" id="S1521.8">However, if Gore had chosen a strongly liberal running mate, many moderate voters might have swung to George W. Bush.</sentence>
					<sentence certainty="uncertain" id="S1521.9"><ccue>Some</ccue> <ccue>have speculated</ccue> that Lieberman's Jewish religious affiliation may have alienated some voters, and caused them to vote for Bush; however, Lieberman's orthodox and public religiousity may have attracted conservative Christian voters.</sentence>
					<sentence certainty="uncertain" id="S1521.10">While <ccue>it can be said</ccue> that Lieberman invited support from the Jewish population, <ccue>many</ccue> believe it would not have made a difference if a Gentile was selected as Gore's running mate, as Jews historically have favored the Democrats.</sentence>
					<sentence certainty="certain" id="S1521.11">Gore's personality: Much attention was paid to Gore's audible sighing while Bush was answering questions in the first of the Bush/Gore debates.</sentence>
					<sentence certainty="certain" id="S1521.12">CNN instant polls immediately following this debate found that viewers felt Gore had won by a narrow margin.</sentence>
					<sentence certainty="certain" id="S1521.13">Twenty-two voters were interviewed by CNN, and none of them volunteered comments on Gore's behavior ('CNN', October 3 2000).</sentence>
					<sentence certainty="certain" id="S1521.14">When asked by conservative Frank Luntz of the MSNBC channel, an equal number of viewers were troubled by Gore's sighs and Bush's repeated invocations of "fuzzy math" (see George W. Bush).</sentence>
					<sentence certainty="uncertain" id="S1521.15"><ccue>Some liberals</ccue> conclude that the observation of Gore's alleged personality flaws seems to have originated with (and been propagated by) conservative news organizations.</sentence>
					<sentence certainty="uncertain" id="S1521.16">Regardless of voters' original reactions, however, subsequent press coverage concentrated heavily on Gore's sighs and other perceived flaws, with <ccue>some conservatives</ccue> coining the moniker, "Al Bore".</sentence>
					<sentence certainty="certain" id="S1521.17">Gore's behavior during the first debate was even the basis for a sketch on NBC's 'Saturday Night Live' television program, which according to some sources, members of Gore's campaign asked him to watch before the next debate.</sentence>
					<sentence certainty="certain" id="S1521.18">Whether or not he watched the sketch, his behavior was noticeably subdued in the second debate.</sentence>
					<sentence certainty="certain" id="S1521.19">On Election Day, Gore himself would appear on a 'Saturday Night Live' prime time special to make a few jokes about this behavior.</sentence>
					<sentence certainty="certain" id="S1521.20">Perceived artificiality and lack of candor: In 1997, after it came to light that Gore had improperly used White House telephones to raise money for the campaign in 1996, Gore defended himself awkwardly during a press conference in which his denial featured repetition of the phrase "no controlling legal authority"; likewise, when a scandal broke concerning Gore's appearance at Hsi Lai Temple at an event where unlawful campaign donations were laundered through Buddhist nuns, Gore said he thought the event was "community outreach".</sentence>
					<sentence certainty="certain" id="S1521.21">The "no controlling legal authority" example illustrates the Vice-President's manner of speaking generally, which was easy to caricature as stilted, pompous, and condescending, unlike the folksy but intelligent intimacy that was the hallmark of President Clinton's style.</sentence>
					<sentence certainty="certain" id="S1521.22">Populist rhetoric: Gore ran on a somewhat more populist platform than his predecessor Clinton.</sentence>
					<sentence certainty="uncertain" id="S1521.23">Although Gore supported trade liberalization and <ccue>many other Clinton-like reforms</ccue>, he also used rhetoric that drew attention to growing gaps between rich and poor in American society.</sentence>
					<sentence certainty="uncertain" id="S1521.24"><ccue>Some</ccue> found this language divisive; however, the notion that this position hurt his popularity is challenged by the fact that his poll numbers went up substantially shortly after his strongly populist speech on August 16, 2000 at the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles.</sentence>
					<sentence certainty="certain" id="S1521.25">After the loss, Lieberman even criticized Gore for adopting a populist theme during their campaign, and stated he had objected to Gore's "people vs. the powerful" message, believing it was not the best strategy for Democrats to use to win the election.</sentence>
					<sentence certainty="certain" id="S1521.26">The Republicans' "Solid South": Gore, a Southerner himself, had won every election he had ever run in the South before the 2000 election.</sentence>
					<sentence certainty="certain" id="S1521.27">However, between the time that Clinton and Gore were first elected in 1992, many Democrats changed parties, due to the growing conservative base in the region.</sentence>
					<sentence certainty="uncertain" id="S1521.28">Although Gore would have won the election if he had won virtually any other state in the union, <ccue>many</ccue> attribute his loss to his failure to win any Southern state, including his native Tennessee.</sentence>
					<sentence certainty="certain" id="S1521.29">Ralph Nader: A common water cooler theory about Gore's loss centers around Ralph Nader's surprisingly high standing in the final polls of the election.</sentence>
					<sentence certainty="uncertain" id="S1521.30"><ccue>A number of Gore supporters</ccue> accused Nader of running as a spoiler candidate, allegedly drawing far-liberal voters from Gore, whether intentionally or not.</sentence>

					<sentence certainty="certain" id="S1587.3">One review (2006) found a lack in literature on comparing undifferentiated somatoform disorder with CFS, however mentioned that a critical feature is implied in the definition of undifferentiated somatoform disorder that is absent from CFS: that some patients experience their symptoms as being exclusively physical and not as mental.</sentence>

					<sentence certainty="certain" id="S1589.2">Several Physical medicine and rehabilitation programs have been proposed which involve supervised or self-monitored graded exercise or activity.</sentence>
					<sentence certainty="certain" id="S1589.3">Such programs are designed to overcome deconditioning, increase strength and cardiovascular health.</sentence>
					<sentence certainty="certain" id="S1589.4">The program should incorporate considerable education wherein the sufferer learns to start at an appropriate level of activity (based upon intensity and duration) which is incrementally increased, at a rate which does not substantially increase symptoms.</sentence>
					<sentence certainty="uncertain" id="S1589.5">Those who fit <ccue>a 2003 ME/ICD-CFS definition</ccue> with post exertional malaise may wish to consider whether graded exercise is recommended in their case because it can cause serious deterioration in the exertional intolerant, and the 25% ME Grouppoint out that many severe cases were in fact mild cases before undergoing such therapy.</sentence>
					<sentence certainty="certain" id="S1589.6">More encouragingly and in addition to the positive findings of the previously mentioned updated systematic review on GET, the Gibson Report also states that GET is one of the most common treatments for CFS and found 50-70% of patients improved somewhat with GET.</sentence>
					<sentence certainty="certain" id="S1589.7">However this level of efficacy was only found in several small trials and were not even compared with specialist medical care or pacing.</sentence>
					<sentence certainty="certain" id="S1589.8">Similarly, like with CBT, GET seems more effective in less severely affected patients than those who are more severely affected.</sentence>
					<sentence certainty="uncertain" id="S1589.9">Its role in helping severely disabled patients has not yet been properly established, but <ccue>uncontrolled studies</ccue> <ccue>suggest</ccue> it can help so long as it is tailored to the individual patient.</sentence>
					<sentence certainty="certain" id="S1589.10">However the Gibson Report also mentions the 25% ME Group findings that only 5% of their members found GET helpful and 95% found it unhelpful; and while the report used the word "unhelpful," the 25% ME Group insists that GET can also be dangerous/harmful.</sentence>
					<sentence certainty="certain" id="S1589.11">Many other patients who submitted personal evidence to the report's inquiry had similarly negative experiences which they attributed to their participation in GET.</sentence>
					<sentence certainty="certain" id="S1589.12">Due to the possible potential risks of GET for CFS patients, the report stressed concern about GET treatment guidelines for CFS that lacked cautions about these risks, and even raised suggestions of checking for heart trouble before attempting GET.</sentence>
					<sentence certainty="certain" id="S1589.13">The authors also stated the observation that GET may make severe sufferers feel worse "has lent fuel to their often serious antipathy to the doctors offering it.</sentence>
					<sentence certainty="certain" id="S1589.14">Some of our evidence suggests that GET carries some risk and patients should be advised of this."</sentence>

					<sentence certainty="certain" id="S1589.16">One study done with 9 to 17 year olds showed that a rehabilitation program (involving graded activities/exercise) was successful, with 43% reporting a "complete resolution" of symptoms by the CDC/Fukuda definition.</sentence>

				</DocumentPart>
				<DocumentPart type="Text">
					<sentence certainty="certain" id="S1648.2">Although the Dvorak layout is the only other keyboard layout registered with ANSI and is provided with all major operating systems, attempts to convert universally to the Dvorak layout have not succeeded.</sentence>
					<sentence certainty="certain" id="S1648.3">The failure of the Dvorak layout to displace the QWERTY layout has been the subject of some studies and of considerable debate.</sentence>
					<sentence certainty="certain" id="S1648.4">However, in considering resistance to the adoption of the Dvorak layout, different segments of the market (non-typists, typists, corporations and manufacturers) differ in the extent, nature, and motivation of their resistance.</sentence>
					<sentence certainty="certain" id="S1648.5">Furthermore, the influence of these factors on the different segments of the market has changed over time, following changes in technology and awareness of Dvorak as an alternative keyboard layout.</sentence>
					<sentence certainty="certain" id="S1648.6">Factors against adoption of the Dvorak layout have included the following:</sentence>
					<sentence certainty="certain" id="S1648.7">Failure to demonstrate superiority in speed, economy of effort, and accuracy--noting that the significant issue here is the demonstrability.</sentence>
					<sentence certainty="certain" id="S1648.8">Few studies have been done on the relative efficiency of the two keyboard layouts, and those studies have been criticised for failing to adhere to rigorous academic standards.</sentence>
					<sentence certainty="certain" id="S1648.9">Failure to achieve the general population's awareness that the Dvorak layout existed.</sentence>
					<sentence certainty="certain" id="S1648.10">This improved somewhat following the 'Guinness Book of Records' 1985 publication of Barbara Blackburn’s achievement of 212 wpm using a Dvorak keyboard, and again in the mid-1990s when computer operating systems began to incorporate the Dvorak layout as an option.</sentence>
					<sentence certainty="certain" id="S1648.11">Failure to overcome an investment in competence in the QWERTY layout made by a large number of typists and typist trainers prior to the general availability of the Dvorak layout.</sentence>
					<sentence certainty="certain" id="S1648.12">This investment has proved the most powerful influence up until the 1990s.</sentence>
					<sentence certainty="certain" id="S1648.13">Typing training in schools and secretarial colleges is almost always done on the QWERTY layout both because it conforms with the expectation of industry and because it is the layout with which most teachers or trainers are already familiar.</sentence>
					<sentence certainty="certain" id="S1648.14">Many QWERTY typists have retrained themselves to use the Dvorak layout because the emphasis in touch typing is traditionally on speed and accuracy, and because Dvorak users commonly report a reduction in typing-related injuries such as carpal-tunnel syndrome.</sentence>
					<sentence certainty="uncertain" id="S1648.15">A reduction in efficiency while learning the Dvorak layout further impedes its adoption by typists already competent with QWERTY, and the organizations that employ them---although <ccue>it has been claimed</ccue> that on average, typists who switch to Dvorak require just two to three weeks' use to surpass their former typing speeds.</sentence>
					<sentence certainty="certain" id="S1648.16">Failure to persuade large typewriter manufacturers to produce significant volumes of typewriters equipped with Dvorak layouts.</sentence>
					<sentence certainty="certain" id="S1648.17">It would be sufficient to argue that the manufacturers were responding to the large QWERTY user base, rather than considering the plausible but unproven assertion that manufacturers had a vested interest in ensuring that typists could not type faster than the machines could respond mechanically.</sentence>
					<sentence certainty="certain" id="S1648.18">Converting standard mechanical typewriters to Dvorak (or any alternative, e.g. international, layout) was often impractical, and at best expensive, so switching to Dvorak usually required a new, dedicated machine.</sentence>
					<sentence certainty="certain" id="S1648.19">A notable exception was the popular IBM Selectric typewriter, which used a single spherical typing element rather than individual character hammers; it could easily be converted by replacing the QWERTY typing element with an available Dvorak equivalent.</sentence>
